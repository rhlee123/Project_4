# GAM vs Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Density Estimation 

## GAM (General Additive Model)

GAM is a generalized from of the linear model, in which predicted values are predicted using a smoothing functions of the features. GAM blends the properties of generalized linear models and additive models. 

## Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Density Estimation 

Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Density Estimation is a form of kernel density estimation that estimates the predicted values as locally weighted averages through using the Nadaraya-Watson Kernel.
